                    <h1> Our Company's History</h1>
                    <p> The company was incorporated January 31, 1898, upon the merger of 17 pulp and paper <br> in the northeastern United States. Its founders and first two presidents were William Augustus Russell, who died suddenly <br> in January 1899, and Hugh J. Chisholm.[6] Philip Tell Dodge, president of the Mergenthaler Linotype Company, served as its chairman for 11 years. <br> The invention of the Linotype dramatically increased the size of newspapers and the need for newsprint. The newly formed company supplied 60 percent of all newsprint in the country.</p>
